# Heart Health Insight: Predictive Modeling and Trend Analysis of Heart Disease and Medicare Claims
This repository contains a data science project focused on predictive modeling and trend analysis of heart disease and behavioral risk factors. By leveraging two distinct datasets, we aim to identify key predictors of heart disease, analyze historical trends in risk factors, and forecast future trends to support effective healthcare planning and intervention strategies. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and visualization.

## Dataset
1. ***[Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset):*** Clinical attributes and heart disease presence.
2. ***[Behavioral Risk Factor Data](https://data.world/us-hhs-gov/c5c07d9c-863c-4d4d-b519-4a2662032fb8):*** Heart disease & stroke prevention, modifiable risk factors from 2011 to present.
